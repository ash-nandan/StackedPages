#  📚🎧☕ Welcome to StackedPages (Coming Soon)
**StackedPages** is a fullstack React Library application built as my first personal project. This project is inspired by my journey back to reading; reconnecting with books, learning and mental wellbeing.

# 🪴 Project Motivation
When I was a kid, I loved reading. Books were exciting, comforting and a place where my imagination could grow. Along the way, I lost that habit. This year; especially in the months of leading up to my graduation from Dev Academy, I felt a strong desire to return to reading. Particulary books around **mental health**, **self growth** and **learning**. 

### Reading became a way to:
📌 Support my mental health

📌 Keep my brain active and engaged

📌 Improve my vocabulary  

📌 Rebuild a prositive daily habit 

I wanted my **very first personal project** to reflect that journey. So I decided to build a **mini digital library**; a place to collect, organise and engage with books in a meaningful way.
